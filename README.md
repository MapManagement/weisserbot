Bot
---
TwitchBot written in Python using [TwitchIO](https://github.com/TwitchIO/TwitchIO).
Currently only [Weissemoehre](https://www.twitch.tv/weissemoehre) is using this  specific bot on his Twitch Channel.
Further implementations are planned and listed at the "Future" section. If you also have ideas or want
to report a bug, just message [Mapman](https://twitter.com/MapManagement) or
[WeisseMoehre](https://twitter.com/WeisseMoehre) on Twitter including your concern or contribute your ideas/fixes.
Each constructive contribution is welcomed and will hopefully improve the code and add more features to use.
